In this repository you will find the scripts related to the manuscript "Genomic basis of melanin-associated phenotypes suggests colour-specific environmental adaptations in tawny owls."

Includes scripts utilized to genome assembly,completness check, polishing, assembly comparison and masking of repeated elements

It also includes scripts utilized for processing of RADseq data and respective analyses

Now updated to also include processing of transcriptomic data
